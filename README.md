# nfqueue-mnl
A small library for packet capture and connection tracking using nfqueue, implemented with libmnl.

## Description
The purpose of *nfqueue-mnl* library is to provide an interface to Netfilter's *nfqueue* and 
*conntrack* modules. The library allows to capture packets and, optionally, obtain an associated 
connection tracking information and set connmarks. The implementation is based on the *libmnl* 
(Mini-Netlink) library, which is low-level and thus requires a lot of boilerplate code, provided 
here. The motivation for *nfqueue-mnl* was the deprecation of large parts of *libnetfilter_queue*, 
and a lack of support for connection tracking on a packet level among library projects provided by 
the Netfilter team.

The *nfqueue-mnl* library can be used as-is for writing software interfacing with Netfilter - an
example program is included. It can also serve as an example on how to use *libmnl*.

The library is not comprehensive as to the amount of information that can be obtained from
Netfilter, and actions that could be performed against it. What is currently implemented in
*nfqueue-mnl* is what I needed for my project. I am sharing this code in hope that someone finds it
useful. Additions, extensions and any other pull requests are welcome.

## Build
This section describes how to build nfqueue-mnl library and the included example program.

Prerequisites:

- autoconf/automake tools  
- gcc (reasonably modern version)  
- libmnl development files, e.g. package libmnl-dev, or download from
https://netfilter.org/projects/libmnl/index.html  

```
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
```
## Run
This section describes how to run the example program (nfqueue-test).

Prerequisites:

- root access  
- kernel 3.8 or newer  
- libmnl.so  

For this example, we capture packets arriving on port 2222, and move them to queue 0.

`iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0`

For IPv6 capture, replace *iptables* with *ip6tables*.

If we want to receive the conntrack information, we need to make sure the module nf_conntrack_ipv4
(and/or nf_conntrack_ipv6) is loaded. The easiest way to ensure that is to replace the above
*iptables* command with the following:

`iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -m conntrack ! --ctstate INVALID -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0`

This also works for *ip6tables*.

Having our firewall configured, we can now start *nfqueue-test* to capture packets on queue 0. Note
that this program is able to capture IPv4 and IPv6 packets; only one instance should be running if
you are interested in both.

`./nfqueue-test 0`

The argument 0 is the queue number. The program prints packet and connection information, and sends
an accept verdict back to Netfilter, while also setting a connmark. Note that this program must be
run as root or with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.

## API
The library is provided in a header-only form.

`#include "nfqueue-mnl.h"`

### Structs
**nf_packet** collects packet and connection meta-information passed by Netfilter.

**nf_queue** holds information necessary to communicate with nfqueue (queue number and netlink
socket).

**nf_buffer** contains captured packets.

Note that *nf_buffer* is separate from *nf_queue* to allow sharing the latter between threads. See
the note about thread safety in nfqueue-mnl source code.

### Functions

`bool nfqueue_open(struct nf_queue* q, int queue_num, uint32_t queue_len)`

Open the queue of the given number and length. If queue_len argument is zero, default length value
is used.
Returns *true* on success, *false* on failure.

`void nfqueue_close(struct nf_queue* q)`

Close the queue and associated netlink socket.

`int nfqueue_receive(struct nf_queue* q, struct nf_buffer* buf, int64_t timeout_ms)`

Receive a packet (or multiple packets) from the nfqueue into buf. Because many packets may be
received in one *nfqueue_receive* call, the buffer must be iterated with *nfqueue_next* (see below).
A non-blocking socket is used, which allows setting a timeout (in millisecods). Passing zero as
*timeout_ms* causes the call to block until data is received.
Return values are: 1 (IO_READY) when data is available, 0 (IO_NOTREADY) on timeout or when data is
not ready, -1 (IO_ERROR) on failure.

`int nfqueue_next(struct nf_buffer* buf, struct nf_packet* packet)`

Iterate over packets in the buffer; please see *Example* below.
Return values are: 1 (IO_READY) on success (argument packet receives packet data), 0 (IO_NOTREADY)
on end of data, -1 (IO_ERROR) on failure.

`bool nfqueue_verdict(struct nf_queue* q, uint32_t packet_id, int verdict, int64_t connmark)`

Send verdict to nfqueue, for given packet id (which may be obtained from *nf_packet* structure). The
verdict may be NF_ACCEPT, NF_DROP, NF_QUEUE, NF_REPEAT or NF_STOP; please refer to Netfilter
documentation for meaning of these values. The argument connmark should be a 32-bit unsigned value
or -1. The latter value means that connmark is not set.
Note that there is currently no support for setting a packet mark, rather than a connection mark.
Such a functionality is a potentially useful addition.

### Example
This is an example pseudocode of packet capture loop, which does not include initialization or 
teardown (i.e. opening or closing of the queue).

```c
struct nf_buffer buf[1];
memset(buf, 0, sizeof(struct nf_buffer));

while (...)
{
    if (nfqueue_receive(nfqueue, buf, TIMEOUT) == IO_READY)
    {
        struct nf_packet packet[1];
        while (nfqueue_next(buf, packet) == IO_READY)
        {
            handle_packet(packet);
            free(packet->payload);
        }
    }
}
free(buf->data);
```
### Error Handling
By default the library and the example program print error messages to stderr and exit when error is
critical. This can be changed by redefining macros **LOG** and/or **DIE** before including
*nfqueue-mnl.h*. Please see source code for details.
